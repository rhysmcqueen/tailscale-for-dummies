            This website was created as a personal learning project to better understand Tailscale ACLs (Access Control Lists). For a while, I relied on the default allow-all ACLs, but I wanted to dive deeper into configuring them. To make this learning process engaging and practical, I decided to develop an ACL wizard. Building this tool not only helps automate the creation of ACL rules but also gives me insight into the intricacies of how they work.

            Looking ahead, I plan to explore Tailscale grants as a new area of interest. They seem like a powerful feature with practical use cases, and working on them will provide another opportunity to expand my knowledge and skills.

            I also share my projects and learnings on my blog at <a href="https://blog.mcqueenlab.net" target="_blank">blog.mcqueenlab.net</a>. It is a growing space where I document different projects and discoveries as I continue to learn and experiment.
